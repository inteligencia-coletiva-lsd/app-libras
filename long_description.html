        Flickr Person is a <strong>demo application</strong> for PyBossa that shows how you can 
        crowdsourcing an image classification problem.

        This application uses the Flickr web service as the source of the data.
        By using Flickr, we have the possibility of using its API to refine the
        searches, and looking for specific tags or descriptions that match a 
        specific criteria, i.e. houses of 1920 or tsunami.
        </p>
        <p>
        In this demo application, we use a very simple approach by polling the 
        latest 20 published photos in the public Flickr feed.
